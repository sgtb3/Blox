3D Plotter to help make shapes: http://technology.cpm.org/general/3dgraph/


With amf you're working with triangles, so in the most basic sense, every face = two triangles. If you understand that you just have to connect the relevant vertices, which is pretty simple. I used a 3D plot site to help me visualize the points


You can comment in amf


You can have two unattached objects in a single amf file


Seems like you can use AMF editor to potentially do anything/everything, but transparency appears to be lacking.
